# HashSeal

A decentralized, blockchain-powered document notarization and verification platform that ensures authenticity, ownership, and permanence of critical documents using smart contracts and decentralized storage (IPFS or Arweave).

---

## Overview

HashSeal consists of ten main smart contracts that work together to provide tamper-proof, verifiable, and censorship-resistant document handling:

1. **Document Registry Contract** – Registers and links document hashes to user addresses.
2. **Notary Verification Contract** – Enables trusted notaries to verify and sign document entries.
3. **Access Control Contract** – Manages permissions for document sharing and viewing.
4. **Reputation Contract** – Tracks notary credibility and history on-chain.
5. **Dispute Resolution Contract** – Allows users to raise and resolve authenticity disputes.
6. **Payment Contract** – Facilitates payments for notarization and verification services.
7. **User Identity Contract** – Associates user DIDs or public keys with their documents.
8. **Document Lifecycle Contract** – Manages document updates, versions, and revocations.
9. **Audit Logging Contract** – Records immutable access and action logs.
10. **DAO Governance Contract** – Manages platform upgrades, notary approvals, and dispute rules.

- Encrypts and decrypts document metadata
- View logs and access expiration settings

### Reputation Contract
- Tracks notary history, dispute outcomes, and rating scores
- Provides transparency for users selecting verifiers
- Supports slashing for bad actors

### Dispute Resolution Contract
- Allows users to challenge documents or notary claims
- Integrates community voting or arbitrators
- Resolves via token-staked resolution process

### Payment Contract
- Accepts native or tokenized payments for notarization
- Splits fees between platform, DAO, and notaries
- Optional payment locking or escrow

### User Identity Contract
